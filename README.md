### Hi there 👋
Currently working on/maintaining <strong>[npwd](https://github.com/project-error/npwd), [fivemanage](https://fivemanage.com/), [screencapture](https://github.com/itschip/screencapture)</strong> (probably a few more idk) and other open-source projects that seems interesting and fun to contribute to.

Ex - [Creative Heads](https://creativeheads.no), [Komplett.no](https://komplett.no)

```golang
package itschip

type Brain struct {

}
```
